The purpose of SCCAF is to provide PaaS (Platform as a Service) and IaaS (Infra as a Service) to users who want to develop and apply cold chain management systems with low cost and in short time. Also, SCCAF enables users to use any type of IOT devices such as RFID tags, WSN sensor nodes, BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy) sensor nodes and so on. We define common components by generalizing function of existing cold chain management systems, and design SCCAF based on Hadoop and Spark to store the large amount of data stream on salable storage and process stream data to detect events and assess risks in cold chain.},

It traces the temporal evolution of local variability (LV) introduced as a result of bias temperature instability (BTI). A 25 nm physical channel length transistor, designed to meet the specifications and the requirements of the 20 nm CMOS technology generation, is used as an illustrative example. TCAD simulations are used to generate statistical current-voltage target characteristics, which are used to extract statistical compact models at different levels of degradation. Three increasing levels of BTI degradation are used to build a time dependent LV model. A nominal BSIM4 compact model and statistical compact models are extracted at each level of degradation. The models are used as a reference for generation of accurate statistical compact models at arbitrary ageing conditions. The accuracy of the generated statistical compact models at arbitrary degradation condition and corresponding average trapped charge density is then verified against TCAD simulations.},

O circuito proposto tem como peça central o mixer de tempo discreto, formado por uma estrutura composta por capacitores chaveados que fazem a translação e a filtragem do sinal de radiofrequência (RF) com modulação de codificação on-off (OOK). Também integram o circuito: uma rede de casamento integrada, divisores de frequência, um amplificador de banda-base e uma referência de tensão. Esta pesquisa realizou o projeto e dimensionamento dos componentes, a simulação do circuito e implementação física do receptor na tecnologia TSMC180NM. A simulação do layout extraído apontou para uma sensibilidade de -52 dBm, potência consumida de 29,33 µW sendo operado em 900 MHz, com 100 kbps e 1,2 V. A pesquisa também efetuou a medição do chip fabricado verificando que em seu ponto de melhor desempenho, quando operado em 1,15 GHz com 50 kbps e 1,1 V, o receptor apresentou sensibilidade de -17 dBm e consumo de potência de 46,3 µW . Pondera-se que a performance do chip ficou abaixo do obtido em simulação devido a uma insuficiência de ganho do amplificador de banda-base. Melhorias para o chip foram implementadas em um segundo tape-out também em TSMC180NM, o qual até o momento de escrita do presente trabalho ainda não foi entregue. Para este segundo chip, as simulações com layout extraído indicam uma sensibilidade de -70 dBm e um consumo de potência de 33,3 µW . Avalia-se que o presente trabalho trouxe importantes contrubuições para esta linha de pesquisa já que validou, através de medidas no chip, a prova de conceito do uso de receptores de tempo discreto como receptores de wake-up.},

Os algoritmos de aprendizado de máquina supervisionado como redes neurais artificiais, surgem como nova ferramenta de predição pela facilidade do manuseio de amplos conjuntos de dados e o bom desempenho em sistemas com múltiplas variáveis, cujas relações podem não ser lineares. O objetivo deste trabalho foi desenvolver diferentes modelos de predição do crescimento de Listeria monocytogenes, Listeria innocua e aeróbios utilizando o algoritmo de redes neurais artificiais MultiLayer Perceptron (MLP) com os dados disponíveis na plataforma ComBase para alimentos e meios de cultivo. As métricas para avaliação do desempenho dos modelos foram coeficiente de determinação (R²), raiz quadrada do erro médio (RMSE), fatores de tendência e precisão. Os modelos obtidos foram também comparados a um estudo de referência construído com o algoritmo Extreme Gradient Boosting Machine (XGB) usando a mesma base de dados. No modelo de comparação com um estudo de referência, com 1015 estudos e 15207 registros, e no modelo com conjunto de dados maior (2653 estudos, 36017 registros), os resultados foram R² de 0,94 e 0,85, RMSE de 0,65 e 0,87, respectivamente, superiores ao estudo de referência (R² 0,80, RMSE 0,96). O modelo contendo 28 variáveis de entrada, relativas à presença de obstáculos do crescimento microbiano, como ácidos e sais orgânicos, composição gasosa, com 3845 estudos e 25030 registros, obteve R² de 0,93 e RMSE de 0,68. No modelo cujos dados de crescimento se dá em alimentos e meios de cultura (5915 estudos e 37094 registros, 66\% de meios de cultura e 34\% de alimentos), obteve-se R² de 0,88 e RMSE de 0,72. Já no modelo cuja base de dados é formada por registros do crescimento de Listeria monocytogenes, Listeria innocua e microrganismos aeróbios totais, em alimentos e meios de cultura (5614 estudos, 40907 registros, com 9,3\% de aeróbios e 90,7\% de Listeria) o desempenho foi de R² e RMSE de 0,84. Para o fator de viés, os modelos apresentaram de 0,96 a 1,06, e fator de precisão de 1,08 a 1,10. Os resultados deste trabalho indicam que os modelos gerados pelo algoritmo de redes neurais artificiais, Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), são capazes de predizer o crescimento de Listeria monocytogenes, Listeria innocua e aeróbios totais em alimentos e meios de cultura com bom desempenho, com falhas do tipo segura.},

As informações de uma tabela de composição de alimentos são pilares básicos para a educação nutricional, o controle da qualidade dos alimentos e a avaliação da ingestão de nutrientes de indivíduos ou populações. Por meio delas, autoridades de saúde pública podem estabelecer metas nutricionais e guias alimentares que levem a uma dieta mais saudável. Ao mesmo tempo em que fornecem subsídios aos epidemiologistas que estudam a relação entre a dieta e os riscos de doenças ou a profissionais para a prática clínica, estes dados podem orientar a produção agrícola e as indústrias de alimentos no desenvolvimento de novos produtos e apoiar políticas de proteção ao meio ambiente e de biodiversidade. São necessárias também para a rotulagem nutricional, a fim de auxiliar consumidores na escolha dos alimentos. Adicionalmente, em um mercado altamente globalizado e competitivo, dados sobre a composição de alimentos servem para promover a comercialização nacional e internacional de alimentos. O conhecimento da composição de alimentos consumidos nas diferentes regiões do Brasil é um elemento básico para ações de orientação nutricional baseadas em princípios de desenvolvimento local e diversificação da alimentação, em contraposição à massificação de uma dieta monótona e desequilibrada. Para evitar decisões ou conclusões equivocadas, as tabelas precisam ser confiáveis, atualizadas e mais completas possíveis, baseadas em análises originais conduzidas de acordo com plano de amostragem representativo e métodos validados, a fim de fornecer informações que verdadeiramente representem a composição dos alimentos do país.

A identificação das perdas ao longo da cadeia logística de FLV possibilita a proposição de ações mitigadoras. O objetivo desta pesquisa é caracterizar as práticas operacionais da logística de distribuição das principais FLV comercializadas pela Central de Abastecimento (CEASA) de Campinas. A metodologia é dividida em duas partes: a primeira trata da estruturação do problema pela abordagem sistêmica por meio das técnicas conhecidas como gráfico Behavior Over Time (BOT) e modelo de loop causal, que subsidiam a segunda etapa com a aplicação de questionários aos comerciantes atacadistas para descrever as operações logísticas, validar os resultados encontrados na estruturação do problema e propor estratégias para a redução das perdas na comercialização. Os resultados indicaram que práticas ineficientes, como falta de transporte refrigerado, embalagens não adequadas, falta de rastreabilidade e manuseio excessivo, estão associadas às perdas. Conclui-se que a adoção do transporte refrigerado para manter a cadeia logística do frio é o diferencial para uma maior preservação da qualidade das FLV, além do uso de novas tecnologias de embalagem e treinamentos para os agentes da cadeia quanto às boas práticas pós-colheita.Abstract: The reduction of fruits and vegetables losses and waste contributes to increasing food supply. Identification of losses along the logistics chain is essential for the development of mitigating actions. In this sense, this research aims to characterize the operational practices of the distribution logistics of the main fruit and vegetable trade in the Supply Center (CEASA) Campinas. The methodology is divided into two parts. The first deals with the structuring of the problem through a systemic approach through techniques known as the Behavior Over Time (BOT) graph. The causal loop model supported the second stage with the application of questionnaires with the wholesale traders to describe the logistical operations, validate the results found in structuring the problem, and from this perspective, propose strategies to reduce losses in trading. The results indicated that inefficient practices such as lack of refrigerated transport, inadequate packaging, lack of traceability, and excessive handling are associated with losses. It is concluded that the adoption of refrigerated transport to maintain the cold logistics chain is the differential for greater preservation of the quality of fruits and vegetables, in addition to the use of new packaging technologies and training for chain agents regarding good post-harvest practices.},

The experimental results reveal that the AoA estimation algorithms provide a very poor AoA estimation accuracy for signals that were originated within the endfire region of the ULA. Furthermore, the signals that were originated within the ULA broadside region have a maximum estimation error equals 10 and 15 degrees for the LoS and NLoS conditions, respectively.},

   abstract = {The internet of things (IoT) manages a large infrastructure of web-enabled smart devices, small devices that use embedded systems, such as processors, sensors, and communication hardware to collect, send, and elaborate on data acquired from their environment. Thus, from a practical point of view, such devices are composed of power-efficient storage, scalable, and lightweight nodes needing power and batteries to operate. From the above reason, it appears clear that energy harvesting plays an important role in increasing the efficiency and lifetime of IoT devices. Moreover, from acquiring energy by the surrounding operational environment, energy harvesting is important to make the IoT device network more sustainable from the environmental point of view. Different state-of-the-art energy harvesters based on mechanical, aeroelastic, wind, solar, radiofrequency, and pyroelectric mechanisms are discussed in this review article. To reduce the power consumption of the batteries, a vital role is played by power management integrated circuits (PMICs), which help to enhance the system's life span. Moreover, PMICs from different manufacturers that provide power management to IoT devices have been discussed in this paper. Furthermore, the energy harvesting networks can expose themselves to prominent security issues putting the secrecy of the system to risk. These possible attacks are also discussed in this review article.},

   abstract = {Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) are emerging as they demands for various applications, for example, military surveillance, home automation, vehicle tracking, environmental monitoring, wildlife tracking, health monitoring, and scientific exploration. Usually, sensor nodes operate with limited battery capacity. Using conventional batteries, it is not always efficient to design long-lasting sensor networks. Moreover, the replacement of the batteries is too challenging to operate in harsh environmental conditions. Therefore, to overcome, one such technique is to recharge the battery of sensor nodes using an energy harvesting system. On the other hand, some of the existing energy harvesting WSNs still lacking the intelligent strategy for judiciously utilizing both the energy management and harvesting system. The review work we present is categorized into energy management and renewable energy harvesting techniques. In energy management techniques, we discuss various methods to save energy consumption of the energy harvesting sensor networks. Notably, we study their protocol design strategies for energy-saving and essential strategies such as prediction for maximizing the energy harvesting of the sensor nodes. We also summarize their shortcomings and ability to deal with the energy harvesting system. In renewable energy harvesting schemes, we present various energy harvesting mechanisms such as solar, wind and others. We also discuss the different energy harvesting mechanisms, especially their protocol design strategies for maximizing energy harvesting, and summarize their merits and demerits. The work also discusses various challenging issues for energy harvesting WSNs followed by future research directions, and some recent applications.},

   abstract = {Energy harvesting has been attracting attention as a technology that is capable of replacing or supplementing a battery with the development of various mobile electronics. In environments where stable electrical supply is not possible, energy harvesting technology can guarantee an increased leisure and safety for human beings. Harvesting with several watts of power is essential for directly driving or efficiently charging mobile electronic devices such as laptops or cell phones. In this study, we reviewed energy harvesting technologies that harvest biomechanical energy from human motion such as foot strike, joint motion, and upper limb motion. They are classified based on the typical principle of kinetic energy harvesting: piezoelectric, triboelectric, and electromagnetic energy harvesting. We focused on the wearing position of high-power wearable biomechanical energy harvesters (WBEHs) generating watt-level power. In addition, the features and future trends of the watt-level WBEHs are discussed.},

   abstract = {The rapid growth of the Internet of Things (IoT) has accelerated strong interests in the development of low-power wireless sensors. Today, wireless sensors are integrated within IoT systems to gather information in a reliable and practical manner to monitor processes and control activities in areas such as transportation, energy, civil infrastructure, smart buildings, environment monitoring, healthcare, defense, manufacturing, and production. The long-term and self-sustainable operation of these IoT devices must be considered early on when they are designed and implemented. Traditionally, wireless sensors have often been powered by batteries, which, despite allowing low overall system costs, can negatively impact the lifespan and the performance of the entire network they are used in. Energy Harvesting (EH) technology is a promising environment-friendly solution that extends the lifetime of these sensors, and, in some cases completely replaces the use of battery power. In addition, energy harvesting offers economic and practical advantages through the optimal use of energy, and the provisioning of lower network maintenance costs. We review recent advances in energy harvesting techniques for IoT. We demonstrate two energy harvesting techniques using case studies. Finally, we discuss some future research challenges that must be addressed to enable the large-scale deployment of energy harvesting solutions for IoT environments.},
